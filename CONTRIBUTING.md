# Commit Messages

## Examples

Here's what each prefix typically means:

- feat: A new feature.
- fix: A bug fix.
- docs: Documentation only changes.
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- perf: A code change that improves performance.
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm).
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs).
- chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files. This could be updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc.
